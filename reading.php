  <h2>Financial Aid Services</h2>

  <p>The Back Office Service Activities (BOSA) allows members to make non-withdrawable deposits into a savings account. These funds can then be used as collateral for loans at competitive interest rates.</p>

  <p>This service helps members access credit even if they lack other qualifying assets. It promotes saving while also providing access to affordable financing. According to a global financial access survey, only about 40% of adults in Kenya saved at a financial institution in 2017. BOSA makes saving and borrowing more accessible.</p>

  <p>The Micro Credit Services provide small, short-term loans to unemployed and low-income individuals. These funds can be used to start or expand a small business like a kiosk, farm, or shop. Having access to capital helps alleviate poverty.</p>

  <p>Typical microloans are between Ksh 5,000 to Ksh 100,000, with flexible repayment terms tailored to the borrower's expected cash flows.</p>

  <h2>Financial Education Services</h2>

  <p>Qwetu Sacco offers financial literacy programs through online courses, mobile apps, printed materials, and in-person training. These programs cover topics like budgeting, saving, investing, managing debt, banking basics, and growing a business.</p>

  <p>Financial education empowers people to take control of their money and make wise financial decisions. Only 33% of Kenyan adults are financially literate, so there is significant need for this.</p>

  <p>Members have access to personal finance counselors for customized advice on topics like developing spending plans, managing debt, and determining appropriate loans or investments for their situation. One-on-one guidance provides support as members put their financial knowledge into practice. The personal approach can lead to better outcomes.</p>
